title: Investigating early lung adenocarcinoma behavior through the integration of multiple datasets
---

Lung adenocarcinoma is a heterogeneous group of tumors associated with dramatically different survival rates, even when detected at an early stage. LADC detected through CT screening range from indolent to aggressive, with most lethal tumors having doubling times of 50 to 150 days, while CT screen can detect tumors with doubling times >400 days. Even though the radiomics field has made great progress for early detection, the biological determinants of aggressiveness remain unclear. 

In this project, we aim to investigate early lung adenocarcinoma behavior through the integration of multiple datasets to improve the discrimination between indolent and aggressive tumors which in turn may offer novel and personalized avenues for intervention.
